This repository contains the statistical analysis of experimental data in R.

## The experiment
The study investigated how to counter costs of constant interruptions at work through an intelligent support system. 
We investigated if and how far a digital assistant improves performance, lessens delays and reduces mental workload. 
The effectiveness of the system was evaluated with 55 participants in a realistic work environment. The type of
support system was varied between participants and the experiment spanned multiple trials. 

## Where to start
The [statistical hypothesis tests](test_hypotheses/all_groups/hypothesis_analysis.Rmd) sum up the main results of the studies:  
Contrary to our hypotheses, participants who worked with the support system needed,
on average, longer to resume an interrupted task ![pic](https://github.com/janinaschuhmacher/Masterthesis/blob/master/test_hypotheses/all_groups/plots_hypothesis_tests/res_speed_per_groups.png?raw=true) and, to some extent, experienced higher
mental workload than participants who received no support.
